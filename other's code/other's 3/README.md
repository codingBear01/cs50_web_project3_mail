# cs50-mail
A single page web application for sending and receiving emails for a CS50 web programming course project.

For a Youtube introduction, see: https://youtu.be/YML6sIlBoMc

In this project I have designed and created a front-end for a mail application using pure Javascript. 

In the future I hope to make other websites using modern frameworks such as React!
